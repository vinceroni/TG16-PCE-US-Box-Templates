#  TurboGrafx PC Engine Box Template

_Transparent PNG templates for TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine box art._

The goal is to create a set of matching format box art graphics for TG16 and PCE games. It's for the future. It's for when some youngster goes to study an old game, he sees the cover art and it's kind of on an angle, the color's faded, there's a random sticker on it, the edges are torn, whatever. It doesn't represent the experience too well.

Another point is, much of this artwork is approximately square jewel case art, with little or no indication as to what the title is for. By using the TG16 box art, as opposed to just the jewel case art, it's easier to understand what you're lookng at. This issue is complicated further with PC Engine titles, as I believe they were sold only in the jewel cases. So, they didn't have box art, so to speak.
What we're saying is, we want good art, and we want to help make the titles less ambiguous, as to what they are for.
Let's be frank, althought the Japanese artwork is generally better, those jewel case scans look horrible. They don't even bother to make them perfectly square.

## So, what is the appropriate design?

 This is the big question, I suppose. I make a case for use of the original US box design. However note, I think the actual cover art is better in the Japanese versions.

 * US box design for all games released outside Japan
 * 1288 x 1512 (644 x 756)
 * Art 1000 x 1000 (500 x 500)
 * The center logo version is the preferred version
 * PCE art in same format, but using PCE elements, colors, and style

 The PCE design is the biggest departure from canon. I'm not going to start distributing new PCE art right now.
 I think it's a good idea, but I can imagine it being a contemptuous move in the PCE community. I need to have prepare a demo set.

 ## Tips

 Save as JPEG 100% quality.
 The 2x size design is designed to be reduced by half.
 Reduce flat graphic using Bicubic Smoother. Reducing flat graphic images with Bicubic Sharper creates a halo effect around the contrast edges.
 Reduce continuous tone images with Bicubic Sharper. 

 ## Console Notes

 ### TurboGrafx
The naming convention includes 3 designs for each genre - 1) Center logo 2) Corner logo 3) No logo. Then, there's an additional set of the same files at 1/2 scale. These are numbered 1-6.
CD games use their own templates, using the TG CD logo.

### PC Engine
Includes a proposal for a PCE box design.
The naming convention includes the system card and genre.

### Turbo Duo
Includes a proposal for a Duo box design.
The naming convention currently attempts to simplify, as the design doesn't currently use a genre element. Many Duo games do include a genre in the cover the art, so this may need to be reconsidered. Color is currently arbitrary.
There is, however, a version for HE and one for SCD2.

### SuperGrafx
Includes a proposal for a SG box design.
The naming convention attempts to continue the simplified Duo approach, particularly as there are only about 8 titles made for this system. I think they should all just get the blue SG color, with the only variation being the system card badges.

 ## Issues

 Unfortunately, 14 updated covers were released prior to finalization. We'll correct these later. They're close, but not the final design.
 The updated design is 4px wider and 6px taller (small size) to allow for proper centering of the TurboGrafx dot pattern.
