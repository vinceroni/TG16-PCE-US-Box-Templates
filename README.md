#  TurboGrafx PC Engine Box Template

_Transparent PNG templates for TurboGrafx-16 and PC Engine box art._

The goal is to create a set of matching format box art graphics for TG16 and PCE games.
It's for the future. It's for when some youngster goes to study an old game, he sees the cover art and it's kind of on an angle, the color's faded, there's a random sticker on it, the edges are torn, whatever.
Another point is, much of this artwork is approximately square jewel case art, with little or no indication as to what the title is for. By using the TG16 box art, as opposed to just the jewel case art, it's easier to understand what you're lookng at. This issue is complicated further with PC Engine titles, as I believe they were sold just in the jewel cases. So, they didn't have box art, so to speak.
What we're saying is, we want good art, and we want to help make the titles less ambiguous, as to what they are for.
Let's be frank, althought the Japanese artwork is generally better, those jewel case scans look horrible. They don't even bother to make them perfectly square.
The template is based of a scan of a Galaga 90' box.

The swatches project is where color issues are addressed.

## So, what is the appropriate design?

 This is the big question, I suppose. I make a case for use of the original US box design. However note, I think the actual cover art is better in the Japanese versions.

 * US box design for all games released outside Japan
 * 1288 x 1512 (644 x 756)
 * Art 1000 x 1000 (500 x 500)
 * The center logo version is the preferred version
 * PCE art in same format, but using PCE elements, colors, and style

 The PCE design is the biggest departure from canon. I'm not going to start distributing new PCE art right now.
 I think it's a good idea, but I can imagine it being a contemptuous move in the PCE community. I need to have prepare a demo set.

 ## Tips

 The 2x size design is designed to be reduced by half.
 Reduce the template by 50% using Bicubic Smoother.
 Reduce continuous tone game art with Bicubic Sharper.
 Reduce any other flat-shaded game art with Bicubic Smoother.
 Reducing flat graphic images with Bicubic Sharper creates a halo effect around the contrast edges.

 ## Issues

 Unfortunately, 14 updated covers were released prior to finalization. We'll correct these later. They're close, but not the final design.
 The updated design is 4px wider and 6px taller (small size) to allow for proper centering of the TurboGrafx dot pattern.
